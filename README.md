# Map-Matching Web Application :world_map:

Map-matching weba application to allow users to upload their GPS data points and have map-matching algorithms run on the data.  
The output will be data points that have been snapped to the nearest road network, generated by the map-matching algorithm.  
The website will have a map for users to visualise the locations of their GPS data points as well as the snapped route after the map-matching algorithm has run.

## About The Project
### Objectives of the website

1. Allow users to upload their GPS data in the form of a JSON file
2. User is able to select between different map-matching algorithms to match their GPS data points
3. Visual output of both the user's raw GPS data and the map-matched route

### Internally 

1. Reads in GPS data
2. Convert from raw GPS data to visual output using Polyline on the website
3. Run map-matching algorithm - user able to choose between different map matching algorithms
4. Outputs the mapped locations
5. Convert from raw output to visual output using Polyline on the website

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage


  
## Map-Matching Algorithms 
### 1. [Google Maps Snap to Road](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/roads/snap)

### 2. [OSRM Match Service API](http://project-osrm.org/docs/v5.5.1/api/?language=JavaScript#general-options)

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
### Phase 1:  
- [x] Develop a rough website (Front end only) 
- [x] Implement a main map matching algorithms on backend
- [x] Output userâ€™s GPA data visually on the Google Map using Polyline
- [x] Integrate with Map Matching (backend)
- [x] Visual Outputs of the map-matched route on Map
- [x] Saving of data into the MongoDB

### Phase 2:  
- [x] Include a drop-down option of the different map matching algorithms
- [x] Implement a second map-matching algorithm - Scaling the Project

### Phase 3:  
- [ ] Automatic zooming into the map where geo points are located in
- [ ] Improve design of website
